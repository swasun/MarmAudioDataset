# MarmAudio: A large annotated dataset of the common marmoset vocal repertoire

This repository contains the code used for building MarmAudio, a marmoset vocalization dataset available on Zenodo (1). It includes scripts for data preprocessing, vocalization detection, and classification using a pre-trained deep learning model.

MarmAudio, a database of common marmoset vocalizations, which were continuously recorded with a sampling rate of 96 kHz from a stabulation room housing simultaneously ~20 marmosets in three cages. The dataset comprises more than 800,000 files, amounting to 253 hours of data collected over 40 months. Each recording lasts a few seconds and captures the marmosets' social vocalizations, encompassing their entire known vocal repertoire during the experimental period. Around 215,000 calls are annotated with the vocalization type.
